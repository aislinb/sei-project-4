      "description": "During radicchio season, we work direct with growers producing the real deal. As forced bitter leaves gain popularity, industrial growers change their methods to meet demand. Real forcing is growing artistry we must fight to preserve. Our growers know that to produce genuine flavour, they must wait for the first frosts and transplant their chicories for the crucial second stage of growth. Industrial growers have eliminated this crucial final stage of maturation by selecting seeds designed to self-blanch in the field. Harvested early to meet demand, these intensively-grown leaves are dull in colour and limp in texture. If left until the temperature truly drops, the plants will build a dense concentration of essential salts and sugars for survival. This is the moment to harvest for regrowth. Pared back, the bare roots are re-planted in the dark and come back as tight, crisp heads with a depth of complex flavour.",

Without light to photosynthesise, the plant changes character and finds a new identity. Forced plants have no chlorophyll; this lends them their exceptional sweetness, silk-like texture and brilliant colour. As agriculture becomes large-scale and less skilful, historical growing methods like these are under threat. Today, genuine forced produce is rare, and the market is increasingly flooded with fakes.",

      "description": "Usually associated with soul food, collard greens evoke a dreamy stillness, a languorous story told in a strong Deep South drawl. However, they originated in the Eastern Mediterranean and only travelled to the cotton states of America centuries later. Their story is in part shaped by the brutalities of the slave trade: on plantations, collard greens were one of the few vegetables that African slaves were allowed to grow for themselves.",

      "description": "Delica pumpkins are squat and irregular, each presenting a completely unique landscape of scarred, green-grey skin. Yet this lack of conformity is only skin-deep; when grown correctly, these pumpkins have a depth of flavour that consistently sets them apart. Beneath each gnarly rind, we find densely packed, vibrant flesh that smells distinctly sweet and stays firm once cooked.",

      "description": "The Reine Claude Dorée is a French variety of plum dating back to the sixteenth century. It was later imported to Britain, and it is believed all local varieties of greengage can trace their origins back to the Reine Claude Dorée. What sets it apart is a truly fragrant, extra sweet flesh with just the right amount of tartness and an attractive green to golden, and even red skin.",

      "description": "Scratch the skin and a familiar scent erupts from the fine spray delivered by the finger's nick. It stirs a memory. But, unlike most fondly remembered aromas emanating from a food, it does not recall a meal eaten on holiday abroad, or the cooking of a grandparent. Once recognised, just how prized the essence of this fruit is becomes abundantly clear, for its oil forms the base of so many perfumes (at least one third of all fragrances contain bergamot) and its essence is one of the main ingredients in Earl Grey tea. Its predominant use is in the cosmetics industry rather than culinary. That familiar smell is almost certainly reminiscent of a perfume, or its one time wearer.",
